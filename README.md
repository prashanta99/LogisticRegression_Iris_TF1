# Iris Classification using Logistic Regression in Tensorflow-1
In this project we will be using Tensorflow-1 framework to classify Iris Dataset downloaded from Kaggle dataset.

This code using Logistic regression machine learning algorithm to learn and then predict the Iris species from given sepals and petals dimensions.
For Data Loading and processing it uses Pandas.

Detailed description about the program and how to run it has been provided in Gaigavale_P_Readme_Iris.rtf
