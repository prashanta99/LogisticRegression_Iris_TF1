Its time for some divine creativity
Hello there!! I am Prashant Gaigavale. I have worked in IT industry for about 20 years now mostly as Oracle DBA.
I loved C before the start of my IT carrier, which started with C++ but soon moved to Oracle development and Database world.
in few years I focused and stayed around into the world of Oracle database administration. In 2006 I came to USA and had opportunities to work with some of the well know corporates like AT&T, Apple, Netapp, Visa, Wellsfargo, Amex and Bank of the West. It was in Bank of the West I developed love for Python and used it for automation of some of the routine database task which saved tremondous amount of time for the team. Since then I started looking to see what more magic I can do with Python.

As I loooked more deeper, I saw more the power of Python. Initially I explored on hacking and thought making carrier in security. I learned few things on Stack buffer overflow, assembly language and also did cource of networking. But then I came across Machine Learning and how python stands out compared to other languages.
But thats not the only reason that pulled me into looking into M/L. It was applications of Machine learning, facial recognition, Auto driving cars, Robotics, ML's win in the GO game using Deep learning that facinated me. Above all, it was maths that was connected with everything.
Yes I am passionate about Maths and Physics. Quantum physics is my love area. Not that I am Maths genius but I am ready to learn and work on it anytime anywhere.

The close colloboration of Maths and Python is whole reason I have decided to now breathe in the Machine Learning world. Give my best so that one day I will work out something creative that will benifit the humanity and the world. My divine time starts now ......
